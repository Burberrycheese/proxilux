## How does GeoIndicators work?

### Assess your needs

What kinds of information do you need? For what period? How often should you reanalyze the data? Whether you purchase individual reports or an annual license, the possibilities are endless! Two report templates are available, one for visit reporting and another for market share reporting. Have more specific requirements? Design a custom report with help from our experts! Whichever option you choose, you’ll get highly precise information faster than with traditional market research methods.

### Target locations

Take time to consider exactly what you want to target. Your competitors’ locations? Your own business? A major event? Traffic in a neighbourhood over a given period? Use our drawing tool to define your target areas by creating custom polygons. Import predefined zones, export the zones you create, and find satellite views of your locations with an address search. You’ll immediately get a cost and time estimate for completing the report, based on the number of target locations.

### Get answers to your questions

The beauty of our platform lies in its ability to answer your questions within just a few minutes. Instantly glean information from graphs and visuals generated from hard data. Find new revenue opportunities: The points on the map could reveal a market you have yet to tap into.

### Apply the results to your business strategy

Focus your efforts where and when they count: Armed with both time and location data, you can optimize all your sales strategies. Use geographic data to identify new geographic prospects and opportunities (e.g., seize the potential of intersecting zones). Fine-tune your strategic planning and decision-making. Compare reports over time to see the impact of the changes you make.

### Personalized Reporting

Design custom reports tailored to your needs.
